The game is a card game where you gain score by matching your 5 card hand to various poker hands. The cards are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, A and a blank card as a wild card for the given suit. Each poker hand type can only be used once. The goal is to get the maximum score you can. If your dealt hand isnâ€™t good enough you can flip over any number of your cards by clicking them and clicking the redraw button. This will cause the flipped cards to be returned to the deck and new cards will be dealt to replace them. You may only perform this action once per hand. When the hand is applied to one of the poker hand types then your hand is returned and you are dealt a new one.
